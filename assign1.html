    <!-- The below part of coding describe my reason of joining this class -->
    <h2>Why I take part in Web Proogramming Class?</h2>
    <p>
      There are two main reasons I participate in this class. One of the reason
      is this class is be scheduled and set to only allow enrollment of
      Bioinformatics student. Another prominent reason is I'm interested in
      learning web programming as I would like to know how others can use
      programming language to develop and create fancy website as well as I want
      to master this skill. I hope it can be one of my pro-ability or skill to
      make me outstanded from others in career path. Apart from that, I also can
      use the skills I learnt to develop my own website anytime if needed
      without spending additional money for hiring a website design and
      development company.

    <h2>My Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm free, I usually spend my leisure to watch a drama or cartoon.
      Even though it seem like my hobby is not beneficial, it help to ease my
      stress and give some color to my normal and dull life. Sometimes I can
      also be motivated by the drama or cartoon as they also deliver some
      message or life philosophy from the series.<br />

      My favourite cartoon is One Piece. I admire the main character, Monkey D.
      Luffy. who wants to be the Pirate King. Even everytime has somebody jeered
      him, he didnt bother them and keep persevere with his ambition. He do
      believe he will be the Pirate Kings without any hesitation even he was
      facing a strong opponent. He has taught me that when you make a decision
      just do it without thinking too much. He is also a happy-go-lucky person.
      I hope to be an optimist as him.
